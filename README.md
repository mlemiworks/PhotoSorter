# PhotoSorter
An app to shift through photos and quickly copy them to another folder.  
This project is an exercise in building a WPF application that follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern.

## Important Note
This application is a work in progress. Please make backups of your photos before using the app, as unexpected behavior may occur during development.

## Features
- Quickly browse through hundreds of photos using keyboard shortcuts.
- Easily copy selected photos to a designated folder.

## Upcoming features
- Save Sorting Progress: Implement a feature to save your sorting progress, allowing users to pick up where they left off.
